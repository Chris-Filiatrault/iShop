#  iShop

iShop is a shopping list app built using SwiftUI.

The app features:
- iCloud sync
- Multiple lists
- Item categories
- Item quantities
- Item history (shared across lists)
- Ability to send lists via text, or copy list items
- A host of useful settings to enable customisation

This was a 3 month project, which after some deliberation I have decided to make open source so others may use/learn from it.
